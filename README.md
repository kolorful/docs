# Telepresence documentation

The Telepresence documentation "lives" at several different locations,
embedded in various Git repositories via [`git subtree`][].  This
repository acts as a rendezvous point for each of those locations.

[`git subtree`]: https://github.com/git/git/blob/master/contrib/subtree/git-subtree.txt

In this repository you will find `release/v${X}` branches that contain
the documentation for that release line of Telepresence:

 - `release/v1` The documentation for the legacy Telepresence 0.x line.
 - `release/v2.Y` The documentation for a given Telepresence 2 release line.
 - `release/v2` The documentation for ongoing Telepresence 2
   development; this is the "mainline" documentation of yet-unreleased
   Telepresence 2 versions.  Because of procedures around when
   subtrees get synced, this may lag behind what is in other
   repositories.

# Creating a new minor version
When you are adding a new minor version, you need to do a little bit of additional work.

In this repository, create an orphan release/v2.y branch:
```
git checkout --orphan release/v2.y
```
create some file in the repo (it doesn't really matter what, it will be overwritten later)
and then push that branch.

Once this is done, in the [Telepresence repo](https://github.com/telepresenceio/telepresence)
you need to create the new sub-directory as a subrepo
```
git subrepo clone https://github.com/telepresenceio/docs docs/v2.y -b release/v2.y`
```

Now you can write docs in the Telepresence repo for `release/v2.y` and push those docs
to this repo using the mechanisms that exist there.
